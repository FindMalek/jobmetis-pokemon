- [x] Create fast seeder with createMany for Pokemon data
- [x] Create Pokemon entities with converter functions
- [x] Create Pokemon schemas with Zod validation
- [x] Test database schema generation ✅ WORKING
- [x] Set up environment variables and test database connection
- [x] Run database seeding with sample data

## 📋 Phase 2: Backend API (ORPC/tRPC) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Update database schema in Prisma
- [x] Create Pokemon entities and queries
- [x] Move RO interfaces to @/schemas using Zod

- [x] Create Pokemon ORPC routes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Team ORPC routes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Pokemon Type ORPC routes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Battle simulation logic and routes ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Test ORPC routes with database
- [ ] Update authentication to work with Pokemon app

## 📋 Phase 3: Frontend Components

- [ ] Clean up existing dashboard components
- [ ] Create Pokemon list component
- [ ] Create Pokemon card component

## 📋 Phase 4: Pages & Navigation

- [ ] Update routing for Pokemon app
- [ ] Create Pokemon listing page
- [ ] Create team management page
- [ ] Create battle page
- [ ] Update navigation/sidebar
- [ ] Clean up auth pages if needed

## 📋 Phase 5: Styling & Polish

- [ ] Design Pokemon-themed UI
- [ ] Add Pokemon images/icons
- [ ] Implement battle animations
- [ ] Polish responsive design
- [ ] Add loading states

## 📋 Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment

- [x] Update README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Document battle algorithm
- [ ] Explain database design choices
- [ ] Add environment setup guide
- [ ] Test entire application flow

## 🚀 Current Status

**COMPLETED**: ✅ Database setup, seeding, and complete backend API
**WORKING ON**: Testing ORPC routes and cleaning up frontend components
**NEXT**: Frontend development - Pokemon listing and battle interface

## 🏗️ Architecture Completed ✅

### ✅ Database Layer

- Pokemon types with enums (FIRE, WATER, GRASS)
- Pokemon table with proper constraints
- Weakness/effectiveness chart
- Teams with exactly 6 Pokemon
- Fast seeding with createMany
- **Prisma client generation: WORKING ✅**

### ✅ Entity Layer

- Type-safe Prisma → RO converters
- Query helpers with proper typing
- Business logic for battles and teams
- **Fixed all "as any" TypeScript issues**

### ✅ Schema Layer (Zod)

- Comprehensive validation schemas
- DTOs for all operations
- RO schemas for type safety
- **Moved from entities to @/schemas for clean architecture**

### ✅ API Layer (ORPC)

- Pokemon CRUD operations
- Team management with validation
- Type effectiveness queries
- **All routers created and structured**

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

1. **✅ COMPLETED: Backend Setup**

   ```bash
   ✅ Database schema pushed
   ✅ Database seeded with Pokemon data
   ✅ All ORPC routes created
   ✅ Battle simulation logic implemented
   ```

2. **Clean Up Frontend Components**

   - Remove old template components
   - Fix missing schema imports
   - Update dashboard for Pokemon app

3. **Test Backend API**

   - Test all ORPC routes
   - Verify Pokemon/Team operations
   - Test battle simulation endpoints

4. **Start Frontend Development**
   - Pokemon listing page
   - Team builder interface
   - Battle simulator UI

## 🔥 Major Achievements So Far

- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized database queries and seeding
- ✅ **Scalability**: Entity/schema pattern for easy extension
- ✅ **Best Practices**: No "as any", proper error handling
- ✅ **Database Seeded**: 15 Pokemon, 3 types, weakness chart, sample teams
- ✅ **Battle Logic**: Complete battle simulation with type effectiveness
- ✅ **API Complete**: All ORPC routes for Pokemon, Teams, and Battles

## ⚔️ Battle Logic ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- ✅ 1v1 combat simulation
- ✅ Life calculation: `remaining_life = current_life - opponent_power * type_factor`
- ✅ Type effectiveness from weakness chart (Fire > Grass > Water > Fire)
- ✅ Battle results with round-by-round details
- ✅ Winner determination based on damage calculations
- ✅ ORPC routes: `startBattle`, `getTypeEffectiveness`, `getFullTypeChart`

**Target**: Impress in job interview with clean, professional Pokemon battle app
**Time Budget**: ~4 hours (excluding initial DB setup)
**Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, ORPC, Prisma, Supabase

**STATUS**: 🔥 **SOLID FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - Ready for battle logic and frontend!
