## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- pokemon_type table
- id (uid)
- name (text): Fire, Water, Grass

-- pokemon table  
- id (uid)
- name (text)
- type (uid) -> pokemon_type.id
- image (text)
- power (number 10-100)
- life (number 10-100)

-- weakness table
- id (uid) 
- type1 (uid) -> pokemon_type.id (attacking)
- type2 (uid) -> pokemon_type.id (defending) 
- factor (float)
