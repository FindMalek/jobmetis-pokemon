# Pokemon Battle Application - TODO List

## 🎯 Project Overview
Transform the existing template into a Pokemon Battle Application with:
- Pokemon management (view, edit, create teams)
- Team building (6 Pokemon per team) 
- Battle simulation with type effectiveness
- Supabase database integration

## 📋 Phase 1: Cleanup & Database Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create TODO.md for tracking

- [x] Create Pokemon database schema with enums
- [x] Create Pokemon types, Pokemon, teams, and weakness tables
- [x] Create fast seeder with createMany for Pokemon data
- [x] Create Pokemon entities with converter functions
- [x] Create Pokemon schemas with Zod validation
- [x] Test database schema generation ✅ WORKING
- [ ] Set up environment variables and test database connection
- [ ] Run database seeding with sample data

## 📋 Phase 2: Backend API (ORPC/tRPC) 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- [x] Update database schema in Prisma
- [x] Create Pokemon entities and queries
- [x] Move RO interfaces to @/schemas using Zod
- [x] Fix TypeScript issues (removed "as any" usage)
- [x] Create Pokemon ORPC routes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Team ORPC routes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Pokemon Type ORPC routes ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Create Battle simulation logic and routes
- [ ] Test ORPC routes with database
- [ ] Update authentication to work with Pokemon app

## 📋 Phase 3: Frontend Components
- [ ] Clean up existing dashboard components
- [ ] Create Pokemon list component
- [ ] Create Pokemon card component
- [ ] Create Pokemon edit form
- [ ] Create team builder component
- [ ] Create team list component
- [ ] Create battle simulator component
- [ ] Create battle display/results component

## 📋 Phase 4: Pages & Navigation
- [ ] Update routing for Pokemon app
- [ ] Create Pokemon listing page
- [ ] Create team management page
- [ ] Create battle page
- [ ] Update navigation/sidebar
- [ ] Clean up auth pages if needed

## 📋 Phase 5: Styling & Polish
- [ ] Design Pokemon-themed UI
- [ ] Add Pokemon images/icons
- [ ] Implement battle animations
- [ ] Polish responsive design
- [ ] Add loading states

## 📋 Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment
- [x] Update README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Document battle algorithm
- [ ] Explain database design choices
- [ ] Add environment setup guide
- [ ] Test entire application flow

## 🚀 Current Status
**WORKING ON**: Setting up environment and testing complete backend
**NEXT**: Create battle simulation logic, then test with database

## 🏗️ Architecture Completed ✅

### ✅ Database Layer
- Pokemon types with enums (FIRE, WATER, GRASS)
- Pokemon table with proper constraints
- Weakness/effectiveness chart
- Teams with exactly 6 Pokemon
- Fast seeding with createMany
- **Prisma client generation: WORKING ✅**

### ✅ Entity Layer
- Type-safe Prisma → RO converters
- Query helpers with proper typing
- Business logic for battles and teams
- **Fixed all "as any" TypeScript issues**

### ✅ Schema Layer (Zod)
- Comprehensive validation schemas
- DTOs for all operations
- RO schemas for type safety
- **Moved from entities to @/schemas for clean architecture**

### ✅ API Layer (ORPC)
- Pokemon CRUD operations
- Team management with validation
- Type effectiveness queries
- **All routers created and structured**

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local with DATABASE_URL
   pnpm db:push  # Push schema to database
   pnpm db:reset-and-seed  # Seed with Pokemon data
   ```

2. **Create Battle Logic**
   - Battle simulation with rounds
   - Type effectiveness calculations
   - Pokemon switching logic
   - Battle results tracking

3. **Test Backend Completely**
   - Test all ORPC routes
   - Verify Pokemon/Team operations
   - Test battle simulation

4. **Start Frontend Development**
   - Pokemon listing page
   - Team builder interface
   - Battle simulator UI

## 🔥 Major Achievements So Far

- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized database queries and seeding
- ✅ **Scalability**: Entity/schema pattern for easy extension
- ✅ **Best Practices**: No "as any", proper error handling

## ⚔️ Battle Logic Requirements (TO IMPLEMENT)
- 1v1 combat until one team defeated
- Life calculation: `remaining_life = current_life - opponent_power * type_factor`
- Defeated Pokemon switch out automatically
- Battle continues until one team has no Pokemon left
- Winner is team with remaining Pokemon

**Target**: Impress in job interview with clean, professional Pokemon battle app
**Time Budget**: ~4 hours (excluding initial DB setup)
**Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, ORPC, Prisma, Supabase

**STATUS**: 🔥 **SOLID FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - Ready for battle logic and frontend!
